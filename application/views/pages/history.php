                    <p>The <strong>College of Computing and Information Sciences (CCIS)</strong> is the newest academic department of Bohol Island State University – Balilihan Campus, officially established in 2024.</p>
                    
                    <p>Previously, computing-related programs were offered under the College of Technology and Allied Sciences (CTAS). However, due to the growing demand and increasing specialization in the field of computing, CCIS was established as a separate college. It currently offers two degree programs: <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS)</strong> and <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)</strong>, both of which align closely with the department's core focus.</p>
                    
                    <p>With innovation, collaboration, and excellence as its foundation, CCIS continues to grow and is committed to producing future-ready graduates equipped to lead in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
